# Emerald Productions

Greetings traveller! This repository is the home of practical application examples for my continual learning. The components inside were created to practice lessons learned in React, UI/UX Design, Responsive Web Development, Accessibility, and Full Stack Web Development. The site is designed using Figma followed by development with Jest testing. 

## RPG Tools

This repository includes tools to automate and simplify aspects of role playing games. All information related to the games are copywritten to their respective publishers.

## Support the Creations

Support for this work can be shown in three ways. First to support my work directly use my affiliate code when purchasing drive thru rpg content, `?affiliate_id=879798`. This allows me to purchase new books. :) The second is support the publishers! Buy their books. Few people get rich writing rpgs and its a labor of love. While working in the rpg industry, I've had the luck to personally work with a number of publishers. They are all a delight so please support their efforts by purchasing their content!
