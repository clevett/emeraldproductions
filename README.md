# Emerald Productions
This repository and website was created as a practical application of the learning that I've been doing related to React, UI/UX Design, Responsive Web Development, Accessibility, and Full Stack Web Development. The site was first designed in Figma followed by development with Jest testing. Responsive and accessibility improvements continue to take place through regular audits.

## RPG Tools
This repository includes code to make role playing games easier to use for game masters. All information related to role playing games are copywritten to their respective publishers. 

## Support the Creations
Support for this work can be show in three ways. First to support my work directly use my affiliate code when purchasing drive thru rpg content, ?affiliate_id=879798. This allows me to purchase new books. :) The second is support the publishers! Buy their books. Few people get rich writing rpgs and its a labor of love. Working in the rpg industry I've had the luck to personally work with a number of publishers. They are all a delight so please support their efforts by purchasing their content! Lastly use github Issues to report bugs and ask for feature requests.
